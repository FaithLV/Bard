# Introduction

As part of testing Bard I built a sample Banking API to exercise some of the different scenarios. You can view the API code [here](https://github.com/sjclark76/bard/tree/master/Bard/Sample.Api). It's a fairly simple you can 

* Create a bank account
* Update a bank account
* Close/Delete a bank account.
* Get your bank account including the balance.
* Deposit money.
* Withdraw money
* Transfer money from one account to another.

I learn best by doing so I thought it would be good to provide a walk through of an entire API starting off with the simplest scenarios and building up in complexity using a real world example.

Please don't take the API sample code as an example how to build API's. I intentionally made some shortcuts to make the code as simple as possible.
