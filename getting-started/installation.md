# Installation

Before writing any tests, you will need to add a reference to Bard.dll in your project. 

The simplest way to do this is to use either the NuGet package manager, or the dotnet CLI.

Using the NuGet package manager console within Visual Studio run the following command:

```text
Install-Package Bard
```

Or using the .net core CLI from a terminal window:

```text
dotnet add package Bard
```
